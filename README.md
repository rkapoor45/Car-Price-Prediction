# Car-Price-Prediction
About Dataset-This dataset contains information about used cars.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.

WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS PROJECT?
A user give details about his/her car like 1)Year in which it was bought
                                           2)Showroom price
